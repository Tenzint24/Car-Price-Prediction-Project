# Car Price Prediction




## AIM
This project aims to predict the Price of an used Car by taking it's Company name, it's Model name, Year of Purchase, and other parameters.
## Description
## What The Project Does?
1. This project takes the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven.
2. It then predicts the possible price of the car.
## Procedure Overview
1. Data Acquisition:
The dataset was sourced from Quikr.com. You can access the raw data https://github.com/Tenzint24/Car-Price-Prediction-Project/blob/4dabd383aba86c7ff267f367534825f795ebbdcc/quikr_car.csv

2. Data Cleaning:
The initial dataset required extensive cleaning due to various inconsistencies and missing values. This stage involved:
Removing or imputing missing data
Correcting errors and inconsistencies
Standardizing formats for uniformity

3. Data Analysis:
Following cleaning, the dataset was thoroughly analyzed to uncover key insights and patterns. This analysis informed the subsequent modeling process.
4. Model Development:
A Linear Regression model was developed using the processed data. The model achieved an impressive RÂ² score of 0.92, demonstrating a high level of accuracy in predicting car prices.
